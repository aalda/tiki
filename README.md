## Summary
A library for functional graph algorithms (_soon_)

### Documentation

Tiki information and documentation is available on the [website](https://lewismj.github.io/tiki/).

### Introduction

A graph is simply the combination of vertices (or nodes) and edges connecting pairs of vertices.
To compute things about graphs, we need to represent them. There are different ways to do
this. 

_Different operations are faster in different representations._ 

The choice of representation can be based on factors such as the density (number of edges 
in terms of number of vertices).
