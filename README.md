## Summary
A library for functional graph algorithms (_soon_)

Graph algorithms work well on simple data structures such as `DisjointSet` and `AdjacencyList`. 
The library aims to implement the core abstractions and algorithms in a simple, clear and functional way.

### Representing Graphs

A graph is very simply:

- Vertices (or nodes).
- Edges connecting pairs of vertices.

To compute things about graphs, we need to represent them. There are different ways to do
this. 

_Different operations are faster in different representations._ 

Therefore a graph can be _represented_ according to the operations to be performed on it.

### Documentation
